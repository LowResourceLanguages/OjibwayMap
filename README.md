# Ojibway the iPhone and Android App Goal
Our goal is to have our App in every Ojibway language classroom and school by the year 2013.

That is the reason why we made the App available for free. Its currently only available on the iPad, iPod Touch and iPhone and Android devices.

# Designed to work in Remote Communities
Our app is uniquely designed to work in remote communities because it does not require an internet connection. Did you know that First Nation communities within the province of Manitoba and North Western Ontario have very limited access to the Internet with connection speeds that rival 3rd world countries? It’s true, according to published reports from Manitoba and the First Mile project, the connection speeds are limited to non existent. That’s why we created the app to work without an Internet connection.

It’s so easy to use, a child can speak Ojibway by using it. (watch our video on YouTube to see a 2 year old speaking Ojibway using our App)
